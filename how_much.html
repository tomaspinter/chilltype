How much money do you really need? Is there a limit? Or is the answer "more"? Money does not make you happy! Well, if you are really really poor it indeed does make you happier, but chances are pretty high on you belonging to the top 20% of the world's richest population. Even in this day and age, most people of the world don't even have access to the internet! What do you need all that money for? To eat overpriced fancy looking meals at fancy places that make you sick? To buy a cool car packed with features a car doesn't even need so that you can show off in front of your neighbours? Ever tried to cook?  If you are still part of the rat race

Desire and aversion.

Following my desire promises the attainment of what I am desirous; and aversion promises the avoidance of what I am averse. However, the one who fails to obtain the object of ones desire is disappointed, and the one who incurs the object of ones aversion wretched. Therefore, I will remove aversion from all things that are not under my control, including sickness and death, to not clutter my mind with useless thoughts, and transfer it to what is under my very control, so I can undertake actions to get rid of those things effectively. I will totally suppress desire, for, when I desire any of the things which are not in my own control, I must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are under my control, nothing is yet in my possession. I will only use the appropriate actions of pursuit and avoidance; and even these lightly, and with gentleness and reservation.

Control 

Some things are under my control, while others are not. Under my control are conception, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything that is my own doing. Not under my control are my body, my property, reputation, office, and, in a word, everything that is not my own doing. Furthermore, the things under my control are by nature free, unhindered, and unimpeded; while the things not under my control are weak, servile, subject to hindrance, and not my own. As a result, if I consider something slavish to be free, and what is not my own to be my own, I will be hampered, will grieve, will be in turmoil, and will blame everything and everybody. Therefore, I will consider only what is my own to be my own, and what is not my own to be not my own, then no one will ever be able to exert compulsion upon me, no one will hinder me, I will blame no one, will find fault with no one, will do absolutely nothing against my will, I will have no personal enemy, no one will harm me, for neither is there any harm that can touch me.
