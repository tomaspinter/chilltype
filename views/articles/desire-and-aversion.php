<h1>Desire and aversion</h1>

<div id="screen">Following my desire promises the attainment of what I am desirous; and aversion promises the avoidance of what I am averse. However, the one who fails to obtain the object of ones desire is disappointed, and the one who incurs the object of ones aversion wretched. Therefore, I will remove aversion from all things that are not under my control, including sickness and death, to not clutter my mind with useless thoughts, and transfer it to what is under my very control, so I can undertake actions to get rid of those things effectively. I will totally suppress desire, for, when I desire any of the things which are not in my own control, I must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are under my control, nothing is yet in my possession. I will only use the appropriate actions of pursuit and avoidance; and even these lightly, and with gentleness and reservation.</div>
