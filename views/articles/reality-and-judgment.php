<h1>Reality and judgment</h1>

<p id="screen">I must keep in mind that it is not the things themselves that disturb me, but my very own judgments about these things! For example, death is nothing dreadful, it is a natural part of life, just as birth is, but the judgment that death is dreadful - this alone is the dreadful thing. When, therefore, I am hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, I will never blame anyone, nor myself, but only my particular judgment of a particular situation. Since my judgment originates in my mind, I have full control over it and, thus, can change it easily. It is a characteristic of an uneducated person to blame others where that person fares ill. One who blames one's self is a person whose education has just begun. To blame neither another nor one's own self is part of a person whose education is already complete - this person I shall become.</p>
