<h1>Control</h1>

<div id="screen">Some things are under my control, while others are not. Under my control are conception, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything that is my own doing. Not under my control are my body, my property, reputation, office, and, in a word, everything that is not my own doing. Furthermore, the things under my control are by nature free, unhindered, and unimpeded; while the things not under my control are weak, servile, subject to hindrance, and not my own. As a result, if I consider something slavish to be free, and what is not my own to be my own, I will be hampered, will grieve, will be in turmoil, and will blame everything and everybody. Therefore, I will consider only what is my own to be my own, and what is not my own to be not my own, then no one will ever be able to exert compulsion upon me, no one will hinder me, I will blame no one, will find fault with no one, will do absolutely nothing against my will, I will have no personal enemy, no one will harm me, for neither is there any harm that can touch me.</div>
