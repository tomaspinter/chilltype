<h1>Mastery and deliberate practice</h1>

<p id="article">Mastery is about skill and technique. The only way to achieve it, is deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is not simply performing a task. If I ask myself, "Why am I performing this task?" and the answer is, "To complete the task," then it is not deliberate practice. Deliberate practice does not mean doing what I am good at; it means challenging myself and doing what I am not good at to achieve my goal. Deliberate practice means repetition. It means performing a task with the aim of improving my skill within one or more aspects of that task. It means repeating the repetition. Slowly, over and over again, until it becomes second nature to me. Greatness is not the result of an innate ability but largely a matter of conscious choice. My choice!</p>
