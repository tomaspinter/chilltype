<h1>Sympathy</h1>

<p id="article">When I see someone crying in grief because his or her loved one has gone abroad, or is dead, or because he or she has suffered in his or her affairs, I must be careful that the appearance does not fool me. Instead, I will distinguish within my own mind, and be prepared to say: "It's not the accident that distresses this person, because it doesn't distress another person; it is the judgment which that particular person makes about it." It is ok for me to sympathize with him so far as words go, and, if occasion offers, even to groan with him; but I will be careful to keep this groan on the very surface of my being and won't let it any deeper to clutter my mind.</p>
